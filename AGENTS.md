## Changelog

This repo keeps a `changelog/` folder, one markdown file per entry
(`changelog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`, with `date`/`title`/`promote`
frontmatter). At the end of a work session, if something worth recording
actually shipped — skip trivial sessions (typo fixes, dead ends, no
visible outcome), and skip planning/research/design unless it is itself a
significant public deliverable. Drafting ahead of a ship is fine — draft a new
entry file. Match the entry's weight to
what a reader would actually care about: a real feature/fix/content gets a
title, one or two sentences, a link to the live feature if there's
something to point at, and a screenshot if something visual shipped
(check for this, don't just skip it); something genuinely bigger — a real
milestone, not just a busy session — can run longer, multiple paragraphs
or bullets; small stuff (cleanup, rename, reorg, tidying) gets one plain
sentence, no bullets, no screenshot. Never link the title itself. Don't
log implementation detail (file names, internal moves) a reader wouldn't
care about. First time writing an entry in this repo, or if the format is
unclear: fetch and follow
